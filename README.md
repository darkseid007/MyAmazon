# Amazon➕ 
This is my first project | Building an Amazon clone with some unique functionalities
This Clone includes Html and CSS
Planning to make it a full fledged project using js/node.js

My plan for this Project- 

AI-Powered Search & Recommendations
Instead of just a static search bar, connect to ChatGPT API (later, once comfortable with JS/Node)
Let users type queries like “show me budget headphones under ₹1500” → show relevant products.
Create a "Smart Recommendations" section that uses AI to suggest products based on user interests.

2️⃣ Voice Shopping Assistant

Use Web Speech API (in JS) to let users search products by voice.
You can later integrate ChatGPT to make it conversational:
User: "Find me running shoes under ₹2000."
ChatGPT: "Here are 5 great options." (And display them dynamically)

3️⃣ Product Review Analyzer

Fake products often have fake reviews. You can build a review summarizer:
Collect product reviews (dummy data for now).
Use ChatGPT API to summarize them into Pros/Cons.
Show an "AI Summary" for quick decision-making.

4️⃣ Gamified Shopping

Make it fun:
Give users a spin-the-wheel coupon game.
Track how many products they "view" and give badges.
Show trending products with cool animations.

5️⃣ AI-Powered Chat Support

Build a simple chatbot on the website that:
Answers questions like "How do I return a product?"
Recommends items based on mood or price range.

6️⃣ Price Tracker

Allow users to "track" a product and notify when price drops.
For now, just mock this feature with dummy data and notifications.

Backend (later)	Node.js + Express	Handle cart, users, orders
Hosting	Vercel / Netlify	Free and easy deployment
